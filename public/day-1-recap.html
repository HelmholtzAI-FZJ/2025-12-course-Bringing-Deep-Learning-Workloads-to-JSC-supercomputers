</section>
<section id="supercomputer-training-and-best-practices"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Training and Best Practices</h2>
<p>Alexandre conducted a training session on using supercomputers,
focusing on job submission, resource management, and best practices. He
explained the architecture of supercomputers, distinguishing between
login nodes and compute nodes, and emphasized the importance of
efficient resource use due to limited access time. Participants were
instructed to join a project for access to compute time and were guided
through configuring their machines for secure SSH connections to the
supercomputer. Alexandre highlighted the need for batch jobs over
interactive sessions for optimal use of the machine and encouraged
questions throughout the session.</p>
</section>
<section id="technical-setup-and-security-guidance"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Technical Setup and Security Guidance</h2>
<p>Alexandre led a technical session to help participants set up
necessary tools and configurations for their work. He addressed issues
such as plugin installations, SSH key setup, and Visual Studio Code
configurations, providing step-by-step guidance and troubleshooting
support to participants like Meral and Emil. Participants were reminded
to avoid reusing SSH keys across different systems for security reasons.
By the end of the session, Alexandre confirmed that most participants
had successfully completed the required setup, with a few still working
through issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-configuration-and-troubleshooting-guide"
class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Configuration and Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
<p>The team discussed SSH configuration issues and provided guidance on
setting up SSH keys and config files for different operating systems.
Alexandre helped several team members troubleshoot their configurations,
particularly focusing on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users who
needed to adjust their paths and file locations. The team confirmed that
the config file should be empty unless users are working with it, and
emphasized that WSL creates two home directories which can cause
confusion with SSH searches.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-key-setup-for-jureca" class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Key Setup for Jureca</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided participants through the process of setting up SSH
key access to Jureca, a supercomputer. He explained how to generate and
configure SSH keys, including restrictions by IP address, and
demonstrated the process using his own IP address. Participants were
instructed to copy their public keys into the Jureca system’s SSH key
management interface. Mohammad experienced some difficulties but was
able to complete the process with Alexandre’s help. The session
concluded with Alexandre explaining the purpose of JUDAC, a separate
machine that provides access to file systems but not compute nodes,
allowing users to save their files after project completion.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-configuration-and-troubleshooting"
class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Configuration and Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided the team through SSH key configuration and
troubleshooting, helping Robert and Cristina connect to the Jureca
machine. He discovered that Robert was using the wrong username and
fixed it by showing him the correct configuration. Cristina had issues
with permission denied errors, which Alexandre helped resolve by showing
her the correct SSH configuration lines to add to her file. Meral also
faced permission issues, and Ismail helped troubleshoot her connection
problems, discovering that her private key file was in a non-standard
location (MNT) on her Windows machine.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-setup-and-troubleshooting-session"
class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Setup and Troubleshooting Session</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided Meral through the process of setting up SSH access
to a supercomputer, resolving file permission issues on Windows by
adjusting security settings. He helped other participants troubleshoot
similar issues, including Patrick who was using a Mac and Fabian who
needed to configure two-factor authentication. By the end of the
session, all participants were able to successfully connect to the
remote machine through Visual Studio Code.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-environment-setup-tutorial"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Environment Setup Tutorial</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided participants through the process of accessing and
setting up their environment on a supercomputer, emphasizing the
importance of using project directories to avoid filling the home
directory. He explained the use of the module system, which allows users
to access different versions of software, and demonstrated how to search
for and load specific software modules. The session aimed to prepare
participants for the upcoming course by ensuring they had the necessary
software and configurations in place.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-module-management-tutorial"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Module Management Tutorial</h2>
<p>Alexandre provided a tutorial on using modules in the supercomputer
environment, explaining how to load different software versions without
conflicting with each other. He demonstrated how to manage modules with
specific versions, compilers, and MPI configurations, and showed how to
purge modules when needed. Florianscheidl asked about using modules with
Python package managers like UV, and Alexandre explained how to combine
system modules with virtual environments using scripts and commands like
uvip. The session concluded with Alexandre demonstrating how to easily
transfer and edit files on the supercomputer using a web interface,
rather than requiring commands like SCP or SFTP.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-code-execution-guidance"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Code Execution Guidance</h2>
<p>Alexandre helped Patrick and Mohammad resolve issues with running
code on a supercomputer using Visual Studio Code. He guided them through
connecting to the supercomputer, opening and running a Python script for
matrix multiplication, and explained the importance of running code on
the login node rather than the compute nodes. Both Patrick and Mohammad
successfully executed the code after following Alexandre’s
instructions.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-training-for-matrix-multiplication"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Training for Matrix Multiplication</h2>
<p>The meeting focused on teaching participants how to use a
supercomputer for running matrix multiplication and neural network
training. Alexandre explained the importance of using compute nodes
instead of login nodes and introduced SLURM, a resource management
system, for submitting jobs. He demonstrated how to create and submit a
batch script, manage jobs using the sbatch command, and monitor job
status with the squeue command. The group also discussed how to set up
virtual environments and install additional software packages using a
template script. Participants were encouraged to experiment with the
process and ask questions.</p>
</section>
<section id="virtual-environment-setup-for-ml" class="slide level2">
<h2>Virtual Environment Setup for ML</h2>
<p>Alexandre demonstrated how to set up a virtual environment with
necessary libraries for machine learning tasks and explained the process
of running a simple cat/dog classifier using FastAI. He highlighted that
the compute nodes lack internet access, causing the dataset download to
fail, and showed a workaround by modifying the script to run the data
preprocessing steps on the login node while commenting out the training
code. Patrick confirmed experiencing the same issue, and Alexandre
clarified that the solution involves running the modified script on the
login node to download and preprocess data.</p>
</section>
<section id="neural-network-training-and-ssh" class="slide level2">
<h2>Neural Network Training and SSH</h2>
<p>The meeting focused on training a neural network using SSH port
forwarding and Visual Studio Code. Alexandre demonstrated how to
download and train a neural network model, achieving 99% accuracy. He
also explained how to use TensorBoard for monitoring the training
process and how to access the supercomputer’s web server through SSH
port forwarding. The group discussed file transfer methods, with
Alexandre recommending rsync for large files and UFTP for very large
datasets. Questions were answered about accessing different computing
systems (JUDAC, Jules Booster) and the availability of course materials.
The session concluded with a reminder that a survey would be sent after
the course ends.</p>
